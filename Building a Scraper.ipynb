      "'Us' is part horror movie, part social commentary.\n",
      "Peele is a gifted filmmaker, the ending is satisfyingly chilling and it boasts another brilliant performance by Lupita Nyong'o in a dual role.\n",
      "It is a testimony to Peele's power as a filmmaker that he weaves this overwhelming idea into an absorbing and even enjoyable film. He got the genre right: we should be terrified.\n",
      "Us is both enjoyable and slightly disappointing when seeing the clever aspects of Peele's filmmaking draw tantalisingly close together before drifting apart.\n",
      "\" 'Us' is a move that looks at the forgotten and disenfranchised - literally those who live in the shadows and have no real place in our world.\n",

      "Us succeeds, but it's almost as if Peele is trying too hard\n",
      "Performances in genre pieces are often dismissed and disregarded, but make no mistake: Nyongo's work in Us is some of the very best of her career.\n",
      "A very significant horror film with a real core, an entertaining story, incredible performances and excellent execution\n",
      "Us' biggest success comes down to its impeccable casting. With everyone pulling double-duty, it's insane the depth of performance we see ...\n",
      "proves that Peele is hardly a flash in the pan; his talent is undeniable, as is his dedication to crafting superior horror movies that work beyond the general expectations of the genre\n",
      "Combines masterful visuals with dense storytelling, and a half-dozen instant-classic sequences. And it's scary as hell.\n",
      "More than just a horror movie, Us represents a multilayered experience that will leave your brain in knots...In short, you simply have to watch Us for yourself.\n",
      "Theories aside, this is a scary, fun, suspenseful thriller with comedic elements and great performances. I can enjoy the movie on surface level without needing some doctorate degree.\n"
